# **Intelligent Shoe Recommendation System with Multimodal AI**

Welcome to the repository for the Intelligent Shoe Recommendation System\! This is a sophisticated platform that leverages the power of multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide users with accurate and relevant shoe product recommendations. The application is designed to understand user queries not only through text but also through images, and even a combination of both.

## **üìú Project Description**

This project aims to build an end-to-end recommendation system that goes beyond simple keyword matching. By integrating modern AI models, the application can comprehend the semantic meaning behind text and the visual essence of an image to find products that best suit the user's needs and preferences.

Its core feature is an intelligent chat assistant that utilizes a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. This allows it to provide responses that are not only relevant but are also grounded in the product data available within the database.

## **‚ú® Key Features**

The application is equipped with various search methods to provide a flexible and intuitive user experience:

1. **Keyword-Based Search:** A classic search method where the system looks for products whose titles contain the user-inputted keywords.  
2. **Semantic Search:** Users can describe their needs in natural language (e.g., "comfortable shoes for summer travel"), and the system will find the most semantically appropriate products.  
3. **Image-Based Search:** A user can upload an image of a shoe, and the system will find other products that are visually similar.  
4. **Multimodal Search (Text \+ Image):** The most advanced feature, where users can upload an image and simultaneously add a text description for a more specific search (e.g., uploading a picture of running shoes and adding the text "in blue").  
5. **Intelligent Chat Assistant (RAG):** An interactive chatbot that can understand complex questions, perform searches in the background, and provide recommendations accompanied by detailed reasoning and features for each suggested product.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack**

This application is built on a modern technology stack designed for scalability and high performance:

| Category | Technology | Purpose of Use |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Programming Language** | **Python** | The primary language used for the entire backend, data processing, and AI model interaction. |
| **Application Framework** | **Streamlit** | Used to rapidly build an interactive and responsive user interface (UI), enabling real-time data visualization and user interaction. |
| **AI & ML Models** | **Vertex AI (Gemini)** | The brain behind the Intelligent Chat Assistant (RAG). Gemini is used to analyze user queries, understand the context from retrieved products, and generate intelligent, structured responses. |
|  | **Google SigLIP** | A multimodal AI model from Hugging Face that forms the core of the search capabilities. SigLIP is used to convert text and image inputs into vector representations (embeddings). |
|  | **Transformers & PyTorch** | Fundamental libraries used to load, run, and perform inference with the SigLIP model. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** | The primary relational database used to store all product data, including titles, prices, descriptions, and features. |
|  | **pgvector** | An extension for PostgreSQL that enables the efficient storage and querying of high-dimensional vector data (the embeddings generated by SigLIP). |
| **Platform & Deployment** | **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** | The primary cloud platform that serves as the foundation for the entire infrastructure. |
|  | **Cloud Run** | A serverless service for deploying the Streamlit application as a container, providing automatic scaling and simplified management. |
|  | **Artifact Registry** | Used as a private repository to store and manage the application's Docker images before deployment to Cloud Run. |
|  | **Cloud Build** | A CI/CD service that automates the process of building a Docker image from the source code and pushing it to the Artifact Registry. |

## **üöÄ How to Use the Application**

Each tab in the application is designed for a different use case. Here are some examples of how to use them:

#### **1\. Keyword Search**

* **Objective:** To search for products with a known name.  
* **Example:** Enter "Piceno Soccer Shoe" in the search field to find products with that name.

#### **2\. Semantic Search**

* **Objective:** To find products based on a description of your needs.  
* **Example:** Write "formal leather shoes for a wedding" in the text area. The system will search for shoes that semantically match this description, even if the exact words are not present.

#### **3\. Image Search**

* **Objective:** To find shoes that are visually similar to an image you have.  
* **Example:** Upload an image of a red running shoe, and the system will display other running shoes with similar designs or colors.

#### **4\. Multimodal Search**

* **Objective:** To perform a highly specific search by combining visual and text inputs.  
* **Example:** Upload an image of a pair of boots, then add the text "that are waterproof and suitable for hiking". The system will look for boots that are visually similar AND meet the criteria of being waterproof for hiking.

#### **5\. Intelligent Chat Assistant**

* **Objective:** The most interactive and personalized shopping experience.  
* **Example:** You can ask directly in the chat input:  
  * "recommend me a pantofola d'oro shoe for playing soccer"  
  * "I need comfortable sandals for the beach"  
  * (While uploading an image) "are there any shoes like this but in black?"

The assistant will provide a detailed response, complete with the key features of each recommended product.
